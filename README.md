# Cybersecurity Portofolio

I have always been fascinated by networks and the internet and have always 
wanted to be a part of it, although I know that with great knowledge comes 
great responsibility. So, I have always been keen on learning how to use the 
internet well and how to protect my privacy and data, in addition, to my love 
to open-source specifically "Linux", so, the wait had finally come to an end 
with Googleâ€™s specialization track in cybersecurity and I have put my skills to 
use  with learning cybersecurity and networks. Additionaly, Having a 
consciousness like mine that always makes me do the right thing will help me 
greatly with  cybersecurity ethics, in addition, my interest in programming and 
learning makes me a great caliber in the cybersecurity field.

In this repo you will find multiple PDF files containing all the work I have 
done throught Google's Cybersecurity specialization.


I would like to thank Amideast for giving me this thrilling opportunity to learn
cybersecurity.
